          <h2>The risks of Digital Simulations and Serious Gaming</h2>
          <p>Digital Simulations and Serious Gaming for use of education can lead to
            risks which may hinder or alter results for projects, and also affect one's personal life.
          </p>

          <p>As digital simulations and serious gaming improve 
            throughout the years with educational learning, 
            students and teachers begin to merge their work 
            with digital systems and serious gaming to see 
            how even with advantages and opportunities of its 
            benefits, it allows risks to take place at the same time.  
            As we see how some risks may affect the work of both 
            students and teachers throughout the years as well, 
            from designing, programming, costs, and limited resources, 
            we see how even with great opportunities we see the risks 
            balance it out.</p> 

            <p>Digital simulation and serious gaming are 
              like double-edged swords that not only provide 
              opportunities but also risks. 
              Four significant risks have been explored and 
              they will be discussed in this paragraph.</p> 

              <p>First of all, serious gaming can be used for the wrong 
                purpose such as playing only just to win 
                or gain points through the game. 
                It is human nature that people feel a sense of 
                rivalry, win, and feel superiority. However, 
                according to Arata (2020), the addiction to victory 
                can make them feel valuable themselves solely based 
                on superiority over others. They believe that even in 
                the use of good intentions using Serious gaming, many 
                may take a negative approach to the use of it or may be 
                oblivious to what to do with serious gaming. Furthermore, 
                we see that it is important to identify specific educational 
                issues that lack effective ways of teaching and guarantee 
                these challenges can be perfectly converted into a serious game 
                (Salomone, 2016). This idea shows why we need to review, improve,
                 and be aware of what kind of serious games we offer students 
                 and whether serious games are being used by users in the 
                 intended direction effectively even after they are released.</p> 

                 <p>Another risk is that the use of creating accurate 3D models 
                  can be challenging due to the complexities involved. Mistakes 
                  in programming and weak analyses used in the programmes can 
                  result in inaccurate models, misleading analysis, unrealistic 
                  behavior, user frustration, and hindered learning experiences.
                   Thorough testing, prompt error resolution, and ongoing quality
                    control are crucial to address these difficulties and ensure 
                    the production of high-quality 3D models. According to McDonald (2022), 
                    low-quality data used in algorithms can cause outcomes to be 
                    degraded and can also lead to repercussions based on those 
                    outcomes. McDonald (2022) stated that when the amount of data 
                    is decreased to 50%, the model starts to show degradation and 
                    when it decreases to 20%, the outcomes were significantly poor
                     compared to the desired target feature, which shows that 
                     insufficient data can cause poor results. 
                     Therefore, in order to mitigate the potential 
                     consequences of failure, it is necessary to validate the 
                     simulation models.</p> 

                     <p> Another important part of the risk is 
                     the high cost of digital simulators. The high cost of 
                     running multiple simulations can limit accessibility, 
                     strain computing resources, and pose data management 
                     challenges, impacting efficiency and effectiveness. 
                     From the perspective of students who have just begun 
                     learning, the pressure to acquire skills through 
                     expensive devices or to compensate for breaking them
                      during training can also reduce motivation and 
                      concentration on their studies. Optimizing setups, 
                      prioritizing simulations, and adopting cost-effective 
                      computing solutions can help mitigate these disadvantages.
                       Medical simulation software such as a human patient 
                       simulator varies in price, depending on factors such as 
                       the brand, features and services and these simulators may
                        range between $10,000 to $100,000 (Costiuc, 2021).</p> 

                        <p> Lastly, it is not recommended for young students 
                          spending for screen time watching and playing with 
                          digital screens. Young students can not only be 
                          addicted to serious games but also lights coming out
                           through the screen can harm their eyes at an early 
                           age. According to Barnwell (2022), education providers
                            should consider the age groups and what they are 
                            providing since it could bring more risks than 
                            benefits to implementing digital resources during
                             classes such as reading. Uncontrolled screen time 
                             often causes difficulties in managing emotions 
                             and academic performances of students in both 
                             mathematics and language comprehension during their
                              school years (Ray, 2022). </p> 

                              <p>Overall, it is 
                              recommended to supervise and manage the use
                               of digital simulations and serious games 
                               to carry out more benefits than risks.</p>
