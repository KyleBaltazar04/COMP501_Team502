          <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
          <p>Advances in computer technology and 
            the implementation of digital simulation 
            and serious gaming in education have brought
             obvious benefits, but at the same time, 
             it is also causing ethical issues. 
             This paragraph is going to state two 
             outstanding ethical issues.</p>

             <p>The first issue is the less accessibility to 
              disabled people. Many digital simulations are 
              developed based on users without disabilities, 
              which implies that there will be limitations for
               people with disabilities to use. In this case,
                it might be an ethical issue since it shows
                 unfairness among the users because some 
                 groups of people are excluded from its use.
                  For example, individuals with mobility 
                  impairments might find themselves uncomfortable 
                  with standard computer desks that are lower than 
                  their wheelchairs, while those with blindness would 
                  find difficulties when accessing visual materials 
                  (Burgstahler, 2022). </p>
             
                  <p>To minimize this issue, a lot of effort and
                     attention is needed from the beginning of 
                     the development so that there are no inconveniences
                      and limitations even for disabled people.
                       Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure that
                        everyone can utilize and learn new skills 
                        through continuous developments and new version
                         releases. Humans should be always treated 
                         fairly and not be discriminated against for
                          any reason.</p>
             
                          <p> Another ethical issue is the 
                          reduction in social and physical interactions.
                           Nowadays, there are numerous numbers of 
                           advantages and opportunities to implement 
                           computers in training and learning such 
                           as safety, time and space-free environments,
                            and allowance for users to learn better 
                            through trials and errors without any 
                            penalties caused by mistakes. However, 
                            no matter how high the accuracy level 
                            of the simulators is made to reproduce 
                            the real world as much as possible, it 
                            still lacks the tension and human 
                            interaction that the users could feel 
                            in real situations. According to Bidwell 
                            (2019), as screen time increases, it not 
                            only decreases human interaction, physical
                             activity and socializing skills but also 
                             results in issues of obesity in the country.</p>
             
                             <p>
                              It is undeniable that modern technology
                               helps students and users to develop their
                                skills, however, it could also make 
                                people isolated from society, who 
                                improperly use this technology.
          </p>
          <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
          <p>Since each one of us had our own schedule, 
            it was a little difficult for everyone to 
            plan the meeting and do the work together. 
            I was always rushing my group members to do 
            the work even though I knew everyone has 
            acceptable personal reasons that they could 
            not work. I feel sorry for my group members, 
            and I am always thankful to them for always 
            following my suggestions, supporting each other, 
            and doing their best in every part of Assignment 3.</p>
            <p> 
            There are several weak points I found during the 
            group work. Firstly, we should have done most of the
             work before we got very busy, and we should have 
             communicated with the Teaching Assistant and Professor 
             during the lab classes and lectures or even through email
              more often, but we did not do enough. As a result,
               we were a bit rushed to finish our work at the end.
                Still, whenever we had time, we tried to do group 
                works together as much as possible while caring and 
                understanding each other, and I think everyone in my
                 group was the best team member. Although 
                 we did not have group meetings very often 
                 during the weekdays, we tried to communicate
                  with each other through social media and once
                   we started our group meetings on weekends, 
                   everyone stayed for a couple of hours and 
                   performed the best in our own positions. 
                   Even if someone was not responsible for 
                   doing specific work, if anyone was struggling, 
                   it was impressive to see other group members 
                   reaching out and helping others even before
                    asking for help.</p>
                    <p> While doing group assignment 3, 
                    it became a great opportunity to develop how to 
                    influence the group in positive ways, think again 
                    from the perspectives of other members and so on. 
                    If I have any group works next semester or even 
                    following years, based on the experiences I have 
                    gained via this course, I will be more confident 
                    to do group work, and I could take advantage of what
                     I have done and learn from mistakes that I have 
                     missed, and ultimately bring better results than my
                      previous works.</p>
