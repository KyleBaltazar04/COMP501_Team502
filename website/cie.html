      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Topic Definition</h2>
      <p>The idea of using digital simulations and serious 
        aming hasn’t always been something many can agree 
        on when it comes to education, as many see it as a 
        way for people to waste time and effort on a virtual
         screen while neglecting their peers, becoming lazy 
         and being less social. However, over the past few years, 
         many teachers and students have come to realize how 
         beneficial such an opportunity it is to use these 
         skills for their studies and work.</p>
        <p>The use of computer technologies for educational 
        purposes has increased over time, ultimately leading 
        to educational techniques such as ‘Serious Gaming’ and 
        Digital Simulations. To generate extrinsic value, simulation 
        gaming, often known as serious gaming, blends game 
        technology and play concepts. It encourages participation,
         offers criticism, and supports learning and growth. 
         Benefits include more in-depth instruction, 
         realistic case studies, participation, quick feedback, 
         group learning, affordable training, and 
         ongoing development. Digital Simulations and 
         Serious Gaming are both new approaches to teaching 
         and practising using computer technologies and 
         some people might think that they sound the same, 
         however, there are two different purposes and focuses.
          Serious gaming is not for entertainment purposes, 
          but an educational method that provides engaging, 
          dynamic activities that foster students to learn and 
          study in a more fun and thought-provoking way 
          (Weber-Sabil et al., 2021). Basically, are intended 
          digital games for educational, practical, and training 
          purposes that help and stimulate the users to develop 
          problem-solving and decision-making skills.
           It is mainly used in education and training fields 
           aiming for users to achieve their goals in interesting 
           ways. SimCity could be an example of a serious game 
           that gives the opportunity to act like the mayor of 
           a city and users can plan and actually create a 
           fully functioning city with different areas such as 
           financial, industrial complex and residential areas 
           (Baecker, 2019). On the other hand,
           Digital Simulations can be defined as computer 
           simulations that imitate real-world systems and 
           reproduce particular scenarios and problems in 
           artificial and virtual environments (Baek, 2009). 
           The major goal is to help and guide users to learn 
           and develop their skills in safer, cost-efficient 
           ways. For instance, flight simulators, car crash 
           modelling, and climate predictions are well-known 
           examples.
