          <h3>Chosen Topic Name:</h3><p>Digital Simulation and Serious Gaming in education and learning</p></h3>

          <h3>Chosen Topic Description:</h3>
          <p>Our group, consisting of Hyojun, Hussein, and Kyle, 
            has chosen the topic of "Computers for education and learning". 
            We all have experience playing computer games, and we believe 
            that these games and other computer-based tools might be able 
            to assist with education. Our society continues to become more 
            technological, as schools in New Zealand use computer technology 
            as a primary way of educating students. We plan to create a 
            presentation that explores the different ways that computers 
            are being used in education, such as the use of digital simulations 
            and 'Serious Gaming'. We believe that these techniques of computer 
            education will help younger students in learning faster and easier. 
            We hope to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the topic, 
            without getting too excited. So, if you're interested in learning more 
            about the use of computers in education, stay tuned for our presentation.</p>
