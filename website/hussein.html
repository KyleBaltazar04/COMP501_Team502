          <h2>Ethical Reflection</h2>
          <p>Both Serious Gaming and Digital Simulations have become 
            more prominent to be acknowledged as a promising tool to
             promote both mental health and well-being. By using the 
             engaging and associated nature of digital simulations and 
             serious gaming, individuals would have the ability to improve 
             their own mental well-being, managing their stress and developing 
             coping mechanisms by using technologies that can provide opportunities
              for them. One of the main issues is stress.</p>
              <p>
               It is said that both digital simulations and serious gaming have the 
               capabilities to offer
               a beneficial way to offer both stress reduction and relaxation experiences.
                Ways to achieve this would be through exercise and audio elements, such examples 
                come as audio from games and audio of natural sounds, it is said that Mood disorders
                 such as depression and anxiety may have the capability to respond well to sound 
                 therapy Julie Nyhus (2022, April 26). In one study a combined sound of singing 
                 bowls had the ability to decrease tension, anxiety and depression while promoting
                  a growth of spiritual well being (Goldsby, 2017).  Other ways to get rid of stress
                   through serious gaming and digital simulations are through exercise. Albu et all.,
                    (n.d.) showed that with new developments into technology, the use of serious 
                    gaming and digital simulation is increasingly being accepted as many options
                     in motivating people, and promoting them with positive health behaviours. 
                     The purpose of this study was to create a useful exercise simulation which 
                     they called BringItOn, which was the target to individuals who were in need
                      to increase their physical activity, health and rehabilitation. It was 
                      then shown that from Albu et al., (n.d.) that three advantages of the use
                       of simulations were shown, one showing how it promotes the proper exercise
                        technique to the individual, individualized feedback as if it was from a real
                         personal trainer, and finally that due to it being closely resembling a game
                          made the exercise more fun. Rossoniello et al., (2009) has even reported 
                          that subjects that had improved mood after playing a casual  game after 
                          handing them a frustrating task, which showed the students had improved 
                          their mood immediately, claiming that entertainment games were proposed
                           to change the mood, emotional regulation, and stress released.</p> 

                          <p>However, it is also known that digital simulations and serious gaming 
                           have some flaws as well as there are chances of these systems being very
                            costly , user interface issues. Cost considerations are a main point and
                             primary aspect of life, including video games. The average cost for game
                              development with programming, testing, marketing, this would still need
                               to be passed down to the purchasers to sustain developers and publishers.
                                Lewis, et al. (2020, April 15) claim the cost of video games can range 
                                to a mere few dollars to millions. One good Example would include Grand
                                 Theft Auto, where the game production cost $137.5 million dollars. With
                                  educational video games the cost would depend on key factors like 
                                  simulation and graphics. Other examples include user interface issues.
                                   This type of software can be easily broken down into two categories. 
                                   One having been the use of actual user interface issues surrounding 
                                   the user and the second point being for platform distributions.</p> 

                          <p>Examples of ways  gaming can be used as a way for individuals who enjoy games
                             and want a way to unwind themselves and remove stress to improve their health
                              and well-being, this can be reflected on to me (Hussein) as I myself do find
                               that playing games helps me de-stress from the work that is needed to be 
                               completed. Furthermore the use of games does help me go into a calm and 
                               relaxing environment as said before in the text. I also see Improvement
                                in fine movement coordination with hands and Audio visual coordination,
                                 this helps me improve my reflexes when I play games, making me see and
                                  react to what's happening quicker. These skills that I get from using 
                                  digital simulations and serious gaming allow me to be myself and enjoy
                                   the time without putting any extra weight on my shoulders. I see these
                                    factors benefit my skill and ability that not many people consider 
                                    but allow me to feel confident in myself. Finally my last advantage
                                     would be simulations and games giving me the ability to see more 
                                     artistic designs and art that I don’t see very often in the real world.
                                      I get to see vibrant colours designs and ways artist have put their work
                                       into the game, allowing me to get creative ideas and thoughts while i
                                        play and implement in the real world.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>However I too feel the negative effects of Digital simulations and serious gaming. 
                                          As overtime I have felt that from time to time serious gaming can get too distracting
                                           and time consuming as I would believe that I could have used that time playing games
                                            as an opportunity to finish some work or improve or create new projects with, unlike
                                             spending hours starting at a screen wasting my time instead of doing something beneficial,
                                              Furthermore there have been chances that I would play alone like many others and I 
                                              see that as a way people socially isolate themselves, even though many days we can 
                                              talk via call, it has been shown that talking to others face-to-face is more healthy.</p>

                                               <p>And Finally the fact that Numbness plays a role. Sitting for hours not moving will 
                                                hurt my body including everyone who tries it. This may cause harm to our bodies and
                                                 cause negative effects to our health as well, an example of this may be Carpal tunnel
                                                  syndrome where numbness and pain in the forearm and hand begin to occur.</p>

                                                <p>With me and my group, I would like to say that I am very happy with the people 
                                                  I was paired up with, as they have been hard-working, and very humble and honest.
                                                   The benefits of working with this group is that we were able to communicate easily
                                                    and understand others perspectives without it negatively affecting our group or 
                                                    the work behind it. A negative behind this was trying to get a group call with 
                                                    each other as we all have busy lives and try to join the call whenever we are free, 
                                                    where we would have to stay till 12:00 am just to finish our work due to work and
                                                     study reasons. Overall This has been an amazing group and would love to have them
                                                      or similar group again.</p>
